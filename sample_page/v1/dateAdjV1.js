//the dateAjd class is the system that controls the users interaction with the cal. It sits on top of the system

//Using the UQCal lib for Hijri date calculations. Commenting out hijri-date library lines

/*
What ever date you give to the convert function it gives you the hijri day for that gregorian day in Saudi.

When you declare new Date() it will declare the date according to where you live.
So in Cali 2/29/2024 11:15 PM

and so when you throw that into the Hijri converter it will calculate it as:
 - Give hijri calc for the morning of 2/29/2024 in Saudi
   - Pay attention
   - it doesn't look at the time only the date. 
   - It will give you the hijri date for the morning of that day in Saudi

Things to uderstand:
 - Saudi is 11 hours ahead of Cali
   - 11:25 PM Thursday in Cali is 10:25 AM Friday in Saudi

Things to confirm:
 - So Cali won't start a month until Saudi has started it?
 - Does every country in the world only start the new month after Saudi?
   - Which ones do and don't?

Too much confusion due to conversion:
 - First we have to add hours to get Hijri date of that country according to the actual current time in Saudi
   - Realize hours do not matter as the formula is only high def anough to give to the hijri date the morning of that day
 - Maybe we won't have to do that. Maybe all we need is what the Islamic day was during that day in Saudi

  - You also have to adjust it for whether its maghreb or not
